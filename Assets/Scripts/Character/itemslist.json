Victorinox uses their SmartSteel technology to provide a flexible material that can be commanded to stiffen and form a blade. They currently have two “self-defense” designs available for special order. The Belt, a sword length design worn around the waist, and the Bracelet, a design aimed at lady execs who want a little extra protection. Mostly found on executives with too much money, they often find their way into the shadow market after extraction ops."
